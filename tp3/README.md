### Scene

- Our scene is a beach racing environment. The sandy track features strategic power-ups, such as time-reducing cubes and speed-boosting rainbow planes, and obstacles, such as toggle-changing crab and reducing-speed snail.

Also, two outdoors are visible. One presenting the information about the game, such as player's speed, time, number of laps, game state and the time left of the power-up/obstacle effect.The second outdoor presents a 3D screenshot of the scene, updated every 60 seconds. Visuals are enhanced using shaders, including a pulsating effect on the time power-up and a 3D shader on an additional outdoor display.
