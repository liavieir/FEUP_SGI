## Project information

In this project, we created a boxing arena constituted by a floor, four walls, and a ceiling. The room features a boxing ring positioned in the center, accompanied by a bench in two of the corners. Surrounding the ring, there are two chairs, a camera, a metallic structure supporting a big screen with a polygon, and five spotlights. Beneath these items, there is a rug to allow athletes to run around barefoot. Additionally, there are four grandstands, one on each side of the ring. In the arena corners, you can also find a decorative vase and two punching bags for spectators to entertain themselves while waiting for the battles.

There are 3 cameras that provide different perspectives of our scene.

## Issues/Problems

Our main dificulties were how to build the polygon, since it would need to support different number of sides and come up with new ideas to the scene.
