## Project information

In this project, we created a room constituted by the floor and 4 walls. The rooms has a rug on the floor and a table. On top of the table there is a spring and a plate with a cake on it. The cake has one slice missing and a candle in the middle. There is a spotlight pointing to the cake.

On the walls, there are two paintings with photographs of the students, a painting of a carocha, a window with a view and two shelves. On top of one shelf there is a newspaper and, on top of the other one, there's a jar with a flower inside.

There are 6 cameras that provide different perspectives of our scene.

## Issues/Problems

Our main dificulties were how to properly set up the shadows, since, initially, the shadow of the table was being received by the floor instead of the carpet.
